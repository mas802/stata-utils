Small Stata utilities I use

You can add this repository with ado updates as follows:

```
net from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mas802/stata-utils/master"
```

Then install the individual utilities with:

```
net install dodrive
```

you can later then update with ```adoupdate```.

For a documentation on dodrive see: https://mas802.wordpress.com/2013/11/22/dodrive-ado-how-to-create-collaborative-do-files-with-google-docs/
